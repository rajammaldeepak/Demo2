Introduction
============

Most Windows users do not have Python installed by default, so we begin with the installation of Python itself. To check if you already have Python installed, open the Command Prompt (⊞Win-r and type cmd). Once the command prompt is open, type python --version and press Enter. If Python is installed, you will see the version of Python printed to the screen. If you do not have Python installed, refer to the Hitchhikers Guide to Python’s Python on Windows installation guides.
